This program is solving the Schrödinger equation numerically using the finite difference method. The finite difference method is an approach to solve differential equations numerically. The crux of the scheme lies in approximating the differential operator by simple differences. In principal, the code is calculating eigenvalues of matrix. 

                          $\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial r^2}{\partial r^2}\psi(r)+V(r)\psi(r)=E\psi(r)$,
where $V(x)= V_{ws}(r)+V_C(r)+V_{LS}$ is a potential term.
                                  

## Woods Saxon potential V_{ws}
 
The Woods–Saxon potential V_{ws}(x) is a mean field potential for the nucleons (protons and neutrons) inside the atomic nucleus, which is used to describe approximately the forces applied on each nucleon, in the nuclear shell model for the structure of the nucleus.
